  ## Customize folder location 
To customize the minds folder location you must move the script file to the correct location. For example if I wanted to it in my main home folder I would run an extra line afre step two. Then run the sh cahnging the file location in step three. You can also cut and paste the .sh file and countiue the steps with the changed folder location.

'mv ./minds-install.sh $(pwd)/custom_folder_location'
